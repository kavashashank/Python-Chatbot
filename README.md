# A .PY Chatbot
## (Integrated into a Facebook Messenger bot using ngrok and Flask)

The notebook consists of various sections that explains how a bot can be developed from scratch. Each of the sections explained in detail are code snippets that need to be incorporated in a bot to make it complete.

The next steps would be to make it more exciting by letting the bot interact with people and improve the code in an incremental manner as and when new scenarios are observed. This is done by integrating the sections of python code with facebook messenger bot where in the bot would respond to people messaging a particular page on Facebook.
